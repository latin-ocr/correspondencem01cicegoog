1.-010u1aoATTHu HEAD OF THE STATE.

Douma the mouth of August, 710 (44), Antony had been oom-
pelled to aot with a eousiderable degree of oireumspeetiou. Eveu
his soldiera did not appear to be loyal to him; and the name ol
Caesar and the temperate and liberal behaviour of the youth who
had inherited that name oompelled him to malre overtures to the
Senata. Aooordingly, he summoned a meeting for September lat,
and ior that meetiug cicero, at the request ol Brutus, returned
to Rome. Oieero never travelled with muoh rapidity if he eould
help it; on the present oooaeion he traversed the 240 miles of
read from Velia in about fourteen days, and reaehed the oity
on the 3lst oi August. He did not appear in the Senate on
September lst3 he said he was too fatigued by his journey.
This was probably, in a measure, the real reason of his absonae,
though Antony thought it was a mere exeuse3 and, with his
aoaustomed violenoe oi language‚ threatened that he would ‘pull
his house about his ears' if he did not eoma’ Oiaero knew that
he needed to peak with oiroumspoetion3 and aeeordiugly did not
daem it advisabla to appear until he was fully rested. He knew,
too, that his patieuoe would be sorely tried at that maeting; for a
proposal was to be made that to all publio thanksgiriugsa day

sensu all Antany ma5 bare wished to express by his violent words was that he would
melre Ciaaro deelare himself in some way or other. We feel sure that the charges os
munbenness which Cicero made against Antony were not all inventions: and that tha
real hatred which he felt tor Cicero came out when, owing to arcessas, his nervas were
not fully under control

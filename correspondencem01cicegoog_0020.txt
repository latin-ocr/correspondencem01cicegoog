CICERO AT ΤΗΕ ΠΕΑΙ) OF THE STATE. xvii

Obviously Antony wae becoming more and more irritated and
violent at the opposition which was being directed against bim;
and when he finally leit Rome on October 9, to take command
oi the four legione at Brundisium, he practioally deolared war
against the State, aud threatened that he would remain at the
city with hia army after hia consulship had expired, and would
enter and leave it at hia pleaeure! Soon after thia, about the
middle oi October, Oioero leit Rome, and, until the 9th of Decem·
ber, remained either in Campania or Arpinum. It waa about thie
time that he wrote, among other worka,† the De Officiis, dedicating
it to bie eon Marcus, who was at the time studying‚ or rather
idling, at the Univeraity oi Athens. ,

The young Octavian aaw the position of affairs clearly.
Antony bad opposed him at every turn,‡ and resistance was

then, if ever, the ainewe ol war; and ii Octavian waa not able to give large donatione
to hie aoldiera, he would not be able to carry on any opposition. It ia a little amuaing
to bear Cicero aecneirrg Antony ol' winning over aoldiera by money (tea, 2), aa he
knew that Octavian did the came. ‘Octavian gained over the veterana at Capua and
Oaailinum3 and no wonder, for he gave them 600 denarii a·piece’ (797, l). But
Cicero did not consider that gitt a bribe or a aquaudering os money; it waa an invect·
mentior the eatety oi the State (Phil. iii. 3). Appian (BO. iii. 39) givea a strange
account ol the hysterical way in which Octavian waa said to have conducted himaeli
when aconaed oi the attempted murder. Appian'a remarks on the whole tmuraction
ara not without intereat. The people (he eaya) did not know what to make oi it.
Some thought it wae a ‘got-up' thing (ὑπόκρισιν) between the two to delude their
menica. Othera, that Antony wanted to get a larger body-guard, and to alienate tho
veterana from Octavian. Appian himself ie in doubt whether antony wae lying
(συκοφαντῶν), or really believed that Octavian wae plotting against him, or had heard
that Octavian had aeut men into hia camp, and interpreted attacks on hia policy aa
attacks on hie lise. The wiaer beada knew that it was all to Octaviano advantage
that antony ehonld live.

t Antony had hindered the passing of the curiata law, which waa necessary sor tho
adoptiones Octavian into the family oi anear. Alco, when Octavian bad propoflod to
introduce the golden throne and crown, Antony had opposed him. amman, ΨΜ
Octavian aet upa braacn etatue ot anaar with the comet above hichead‚ andthere wae a
ahongcxhibition of public feeling on hie behall, Antcny had even uaed violentssmaaeuree
towards him (Dio Orac. xlv. d). Again, when the people whhed to elect Octavian
lucanae suffectae, he iaaued a consular edict that young Caesar ahonld not take any
illegal atep, or he (Antony) would uae against him the rull extent ot hie power3 and
finally, when the people etill aeemed likely to elect him, Antcny declarad that the
electior should not take placo, and that the tribunae already in odlcegwere quite
sufficient (App. iii. 31). Compare aleo Veli. ii. 60, 0. caesar tacente cotidiaci« Aeta·

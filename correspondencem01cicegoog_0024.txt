CICERO AT THE HEAD OF THE ems. xxi

this time, iear the danger of rearing the lion’s whelp in the State3
his repugnanoe to join with Octavian was mainly an affair oi
sentiment and principle*

A comio scene in this serious drama is enaoted hy young
Quintus. He had been ‘Antony's right-hand man, save tha
mark' (Antonii clostello), and hoped to get from him what he had
failed to get from (lassant But later he deolared that he could
not tolerate Antony, and was determined to transfer his valuahle
services to Brutus and (lessius3 he added, that Antony has ashed
him to nominate him dictator, and to seiae some strong position
in order to secure his tyranny, but that he had refused lest he
should offend his father, with whom he appears, however, to have
quarrelled. He now professed a desire to live with his father.
Quintus was delighted3 Marcus was amared. ‘Did you ever,' he

nebulonem) ΡΣ Mixed up with this lunatio conduct (cluniensi) oi
young Quintus is some projeot oi marriage on his part with
a lady-a widow of no great oharms of person-the details of
which affair we cannot clearly understand. But, at any rate,

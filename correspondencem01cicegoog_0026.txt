CICERO AT THE HEAD OF THE STATE, xxiii

Things looked very favourable ior Antony; but he proved his
own enemy. He seourged some soldiers at Suessa whom he had
imprisoned, probably owing to a mutinous spirit which they dis· ,
played efter the emissaries oi Octavian had tempered with them τ’
and when the legions in Brundisium became disorderly,-owing to
the promises oi Octavian, and the regard in which they had held
him when both he and they were at Apollonia‚† but chiefly owing
to the comparatively small donation which they had received irom
Antony, only 400 sesterces-he executed a number oi centurione
and soldiersss in order to entorce discipline. Antony had the
virtues and vices oi a military man, and he would never tolerata
anything like disobedienee or mutiny. But the time had gone
by ior such rigour: it was out-oi-‹late 35 and the result was that
when Antony hurried oli to Rome with the Legio Alaudarum,
ordering the other legions to follow him, the Martiae legion,
and shortly aiter the Fourth, deserted him, and joined Octavian.

The fortune oi the struggle seemed once again to hove
changed. Antony had issued an edict calling a meeting oi the
Senate ior November 24, and, according to Cicero, had threatened
death to his enemies, the tribunes, L. Cassius, D. Carfulenus, and
Ti. Cannutius, ii they appeared; while deelaring, at thesemo

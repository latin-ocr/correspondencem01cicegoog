passed by the Soneio, and ssid that they amounted 10 adceleration
of war against Antony.

On the l9th Oieero wrote (811) to D. Brutus, and urged him
to continue 10 001 with the same spirit which he had hitherto
displayad, and 10 regard the real will of the Senate us if it was
their formally expressed opinion-for the frse expression of
sentiment was hindered by intimidetion. This shows the nn·

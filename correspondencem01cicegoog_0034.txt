honours his step-father Philippus added an equestrian statue*
'Phe Senate further appointed Octavian in company with the
consuls to carry on the war against Antony.†

'Phe debate on the question oi wer against Antony was
continued on the 2nd, and (licere would have had a deoided
majority it the tribune Salvius had not adjoumed the debete,
in this matter alone aeting against Ciceross On the 3rd Oioero’s
proposals ol towards and honours to D. Brutus, Octavian, and the
soldiers were adopted. But during the night of the 3rd and 4th,
the eamest exertions ol the family end friends oi Antony pre·
veiled so iar that a compromise was adopted, and it was enaoted
-thatambassadors be sent, not to negotiata, but to peremptorily order
Antony to raise the siege ol Mutina, to leave Cisalpine Gaul,
to remain 200 miles away from Rome, and to put himself at the
disposal ol the Senatu: in ease ot disobedienoe, war was to be
deelared.§ Meanwhile the consuls were oommissioned to prepare
ior this exigenoy. To Hirtius, not yet recovered from his illness,
the duty was allotted ol marching forth to the support oi Octavian,
while Pansa was antrusted with the taslr of loolring atter affairs
in the city. Leries were set on foot throughout Italy, which
Cicero says were responded to with alaerity.

Sulpicius, Piso, and Philippus were appointed ambassadors.

hcen granted only to three Roman citizens within the last ³00 years, to Sulla, Pompey,
and Caesar.

§According to App. iii. o'l Cicero was ordered to dmw up the mandate, and his
draiting was both aggressire (φιλονείκως) and lalss; hs was driven on not so much
irum personal hostility as by fate. The Deity, it appears, was bringing about s change
in the state through a period of confusion (τοῦ δαιμονίου τὰ κοινὰ ἐς μεταβολὴν
ἐνοχλοῦντος), and derising ill to Cicero himself. Appian is very bitter against (11οοιοί
policy at this period. In the next chapter hs speaks oi the extravagsnce (rt ἀλλόκοτοι)
of the mandate.

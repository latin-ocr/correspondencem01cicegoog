'I'his ie really not a Philippio at all, but a warm encomium on a
personal friend, a man of great atteinmente and high character,
who in extreme ill-heclth had put himself at the service of the
State, and had virtually given his life for his country. The other
two ambassadors returned, aud
‘Their conduct (writes Cicero to Cassius, 818, 1) hasbeen 11 diegraca-
ful and scandalous as could be. Despatohed to bear definita erdere tu

Olonico AT THE HEAD OF THE STA TE. xxxv

valid* Side hy side with these laws were some ioolish attempta
to eontinue the anti-Caesarian 11111111, suoh as a promise to the
people 11 Massilia that the privileges 11 whioh they had been
deprived by Caesar should be restored to them ;† and some tallr oi
annulling the Lex Hirtia which had restrioted the J us Honorum
of eertain Pompeiana. Cioero sums up the leelings 11 the prineipal
aotors in the situation in a letter to Trebonius (819, 3) :—

‘We have 1 strong Senate; but 11 the aemulare, some 1111111111, some
disloyal. We have sustained aserere loss in Servius. Lucius Caesar is
most loyal, but as being Antony’s uuele does not propose any vigorous
motions. The consuls 111 excellent, D. Brutus noble, the boy Caesar
excellent: I hope he will complete the good oourse he hes begum’

Cicero then says how essential he was in preventing Antony from
proooeding to downright tyrauny. A little later ha wrote a
oheeriul letter to Paetus (820) urging him not to lorego sooiety,

but adding

‘do not think that, because I write in a spontive strain, 1 have given
up all regard 111 the State. Bolieve me, my dear Paetus, all my aon·
cern, all my aare, night arrd day, is that my follow-citizens may live in
salety and freedom. 1 omit no opportunity 111 admonition, aetion, watch-
fulness; in short 1 1111 my resolution so firm that l think, if I must lay
down my life in this task and 11 this post, that my end will heve been u
glorious one!

We must now say 1 few words about Marous Brutus. After
leaving Italy he had repaired to Athens and, iu the intervals
11 attending philosophieal lecturos, had made preparationa ior
war. Among many young men studying at Athena, who joined
him, was young Cicero. The governor 11 Macedonia, Hortensius
Hortalus, put himself at the service 11 Brutus, and Vatinius,
governor 11 Illyrioum, surrendered his ioroes to him. 'Phe

†From Att. xiv. 1⁴, 6 (119), we leura that 11111 Caesar’s death Massilia had
applied tor a restitution 11 the privileges 11 whioh Caesar had deprived them; und that
Atticus had supported their cause. But the grant does not appear to have 111111111-
flrmed; for Caelius and the Antoniana persistad in attaching Massilia in 1111811111
(Phil. viii. 18), and 1111 constitutionalists could not do mora than prwnise restitution
(Phil. xiii. ³2).

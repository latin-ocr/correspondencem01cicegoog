CICERO ΔΤ THE HEAD OF THE STATE. xxxvii

ι ii the minds of this Hense are to be directed by the nod of the veterana,

,' and all our deeds and words are to be regulated by their will and pleasure,
we should pray for death, which Roman citizens have always preferred to
slavery!

The whole speech is pitohed in a very high hey and is instinct
with eloquent aud noble, though unfortunately impraotioable‚
aspiratione. Itis little wonder that the Sancte, under the spoll
of Cicero’s eloquenoe‚ assented to his proposal.

Presently there arrived the news of the murder of Trebonius
by Dolabella. Dolabella had left Rome in October to take up
the govemment ol Syria, had spent about two months in the
Grecian peninsula, and advanced with one legion into Asia early
in 711 (43). Here he was excluded from Smyrna by Trebonius 3
but, aiter an ostensible reconciliation and departure, he returned
suddenly, brohe into the town and murdered Trebonius. On
reoeipt of the news Dolabella was promptly declared a publio
enemy, and thus virtually deposed from his govemment of Syria.
To whom was it to be given? In the Eleventh Philippis, Cicero
urged that Cassius should be appointed to that province with a
rricius trime—rium in Asia and Bithynia, and should be commissioned
to carry on the war against Dolabella*

This proposal was rejected, though similar authority had been
granted to Brutus. We think the reason ior this diversity of
treatment was thot tho Senate disspproved and feared the violent
and untrustworthy character of Cassius. Some of the family
oi Cassius, too, objected to Cicero’s motion.† Brutus seems also
to have thought that the jealousy oi the Caesariau party would
be excited by publishing an aooonnt of the successes of Cassius.‡
The proposal finally adopted was that oi Galenus supported by
Pansa, that the consuls, after finishing the war in North Italy,

³ This speech becomes a Philippis from the fact that Cicero, in expressing his
burning indignation against Dolabella, urged his hearers to rememher that suoh
a sate as beiel Trebonius was the fate which all true citizens might expect from
Dolabells's friend and colleagua Antony. It must have been a bitter blow to Cicero
that the man whom Tullia had loved had now become s rebel and s murderer.
‘Indaed life is ot little value to me now,' says Cicero iu a subsequent speech (Phil.
xii. 21), ‘especially as Dolabella has made death a blessing lor which Ι must
erar!

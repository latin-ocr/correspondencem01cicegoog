CICERO AT THE BEAD OF ΤΙΙΕ STA TE. xxxix

oi D. Brutus were seriously alarmed ior lris safety, and icared
that, if Antouy succeeded in taking Mutina, Decimus would
share the fate of Trebonius. The supportare of Antony, Piso and
Calenus, accordingly, thought this was a favourabla time to move
for another embassy to be sent to Antony. In this they were
successful by the aid oi Pansa; and without protest at the time
from Cicero, five ambassadors, representing the different parties
in the Senate, Servilius Isauricus, L. Caesar, Piso, Calenus, aud
Cicero himself were appointed. But a nigbt's reflection conrineed
Cicero ol the inexpedieney and futility oi such a proceediug3 and
in the Twelith Philippio he frankly confessed bis error and urged
his objections tc the proposed ambassy. The enthusiaam of the
people‚ he said, would evaporate; Antony would certainly not
moderate his proposals; he would be intolerable if he returned
to Rome; and lastly the enmity between himself and Antony
had become too bitter to admit ol his taking part in any such
embassy. Again Cicero’s eloquence aud arguments influenced the
Senate, and the proposal ot Piso and Calenus dropped.

On the l9th oi March the Senate paid Cicero a graceiul
compliment, which he thus describes in a letter to Cornificius
(825 -

) ‘On the Quinquatrus I pleaded your cause in a full Senate with the

goddess of the feast propitious (seon s'nm'ta Minerca); for on that day the

&nate decreed that my statue of Minerva, the guardian ot the city, which
had been thrown down by a storm, should be set up again!

This whole letter is interesting, especially the words with which it
concludes, and which gire the heynote oi all Cicero’s exhortatione
to his friends at the time.

‘There is one ahip ior all good men and true, and we are doing our
best to keep her course straight. Hearen grant that her· voyage may

haring a double liver 1) that the day was afterwards celebrated as a specially fortunate

reterens, the Martias, and tho Fourtb, two of caecati and recruus combined, and onc

CICERO ΛΤ THE HEAD OF THE STATE. xli

Very different was an official letter (833) received early in
April from L. Munatius Plancus, governor of Transalpino Gaul.
He had shortly before advocated peace, and been gravely rebuked
by Cicero, who earnestly urged him to dissociato himself from his
former caesarien allies, and to embraoe the side which defended
the authority of the Senatc and the liberty of the people, remind-
ing him thet then only has truc peace been obtained when
all fear of slavery has been removed (826, 2-3). Now Plancus
writes stating that he was entirely at the disposal oi the Senate,
and thet his apparent vacillation hitherto was due to a desire to
abstsin from an over-hasty declaration of his polioy (a fault which
had brought serious trouble on Decimus Brutus), and meanwhile to
convince both his army and the surrounding states* that it was
more advisable to hope for moderate rewards from the legitimatc
authorities thau to trust the extravagant promises of Antony.
He wished also to discover the sentimenta of the other provincial
’ govemors, so that all might act with one accord in defence ol
liberty; and he desired to strengthen his own army sufficiently
so that his open declaration of loyalty to the Sancte should carry
with it a weight and authority which it would not otherwise
possess. ‘From this you can see that during all this long time

there has been no elumbering in my devotion to the maintenance
of the vital interests of the Statc' (833, 5).†

This deoidcd expression of devotion, after his long vacillation
which caused even Antony to spealr othim asacharer in his
designs,‡ led Cicero to propose very complimentary votes in his

⁴ Plenam appears to have been singularly successful in gaining the haarty oo-
operation of the native Gauls to hia rulo, by a combination of military slill, justice,
and general discretiori (789, 1; cp. 8³3, l ; 897, 2 ; 907, 1). But still he felt that he
must be vary watchfnl in respect of them, lest they should take Rome’s difficulty for
their opportunity (aa inter aliena sitia leae yantas nostra mala suam patent occasionem,
808, 4).

tWhat was the real cause of this sudden alteration of the views ot Plancus, who
up to this had maintained a consistent reservo, and had expressed no deoidcd opinion
against antony? It was, as M. J nllien (p. ol) acntely sees, the demand of Antony to
he given Gallia Comata (cp. above, p. xxxiii) in exchange for Gualpine Gaul (Phil. viii.
27). Plancus had been, ss the saying is, ‘sitting on the hedge’ ; but now that one of
the parties interferee vitally with his interests, he takes a side; and in this able and
andaricus letter he does not apologiae for his vacillation, bnt actually makes a merit cf

it, apfficlares that he was aoting all along in the interests ol the State.

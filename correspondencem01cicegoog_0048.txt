OIOERO Ar THE HEAD OF THE STATE. xlv

About the llth, news arrived in Rome that Antony had gained
a vietory, and was marohing on tha oity. Then followed three
days oi grave anxietyior Oioero and the eonstitutionaliste (844, 2).
Pansa was reported to have been slain, and the Antoniane spread
a rumour that Oieero intended to assume the oonsulship thereby
venant. When the rumour began to gain eredendo, and exeita·
ment was rising, on the 20th Oioero's good friend, the tribune
Appuleius, ealled a meeting, and shewed that suah rumours were
uniounded and absurd. A lew hours later authentia news of the
Battle ol Forum Gallorum arrived, whereupon the people made
a demonstration in (linero's honour, whioh, as he says himself,
‘amply rewarded (if true and real merit elaims any reward) my
days and nights oi labour on their bahali.’ He was oarried to the
(lapitol ‘almost in triumph’* by the enthusiastio orowd, and
again to the Rostra, applauded and congratulated, and unani·
mously aeknowledged by the people ae their saviour. ‘That‚'
says Cicero, ‘is, in my opinion, a legitimate and real triumph
when an unanimous state reoognines the merite oi those who have
done her signal servios.’†

On the 2lst a maeting ol the senata was held, and P. Servilius
proposed that the sapum he laid asida, and the tayo be resumed;
and that apublie thanlregiving ba held in honour oi the vietory.
(lioero, though he must have been wrought into a great state oi
exeitement hythe apparent suooess of his poliey, in the Four·
teenth Philippio depreeated the adoption oi the garb oi peaoa
until the siege oi Mutina was raised; but he warmly supported
the proposal oi Servilius, that a publio thanksgiving should be
held in honour oi the generale, and voted that it should extend to
fifty days. ‘Servilius' he said, ‘by moving for a thanksgiving,
has implicitly proved Antony and his followers to be enemies; for
a thanlrsgiving has never been votad in the ease ol a war between
citizens! He renewed his promises to tha soldiers; proposed that a
monument be ereeted in honour ol the fallen3 and, aiter the high
Roman fashion‚ spoke weighty and solemn words on the shortness
ol life and tha etemity ot glory.‡ This speeoh, the last publio

CICERO AT THE HEAD OF THE STATE. xlvii

hold the province of Syria, and to have a avains imperium in the
other provinces east oi Graece-all high honours bestowed on the
mnrderers of Caesar-must have clearly shown Octavian the
course in which the Sancte was proceeding to duent its polioy, and
must have warned him oi the ‘shelving,' if nothing worse, which
awaited him ii he did not aot in aeli-deienoe, with judgment,
ensrgy, and denisium*

An opportunity to exhibit that energy and decision was given
by a paltry attempt of the Senate to communicate the resolution
which had been passed to the soldiers oi Octavian without his
knowledge.† His soldiers, he knew, were thoronghly lcyal to
him, and brocked ill that he and they should be put in an inferior
position to the soldiers ol Decimus. He accordingly demanded
a triumph for himself. Meanwhile he remained inactiva, and
took no measures to pursue antony, or hinder Ventidius, the
trusty lientenant oi Antony, from marching across country to join
him; nay, heaven treated strugglers ol the enemy with the

' npon Antony, who was so aggressivc and insolent (ἐπιπολάζοντα ὑπεροψίᾳ). We read
in the same author (iii. 66) that, in the carly part oi the year, Hirtius dividcd his

We may fairly regard the conduct 01 Octavian at this time, in
allowing Antony 10 escape, as indicating the turning-point in 1110
0111111110 towards the senatorial party.

Antony determinod not to continue the contest about Mutina.
Appian (iii. 72) considers that he should havedone so, aud that the
gods blinded him when they disposed him to retreat. But Appian
gives good reasons why hadid retreat. He icared that Octavian,

being useless, he would suffer a deleat 3 and in that 0000, Lepidus
and Plancus would scorn him ς* while, by retiring, he would be

Plancus. Accordingly, he 1011 Mutina 011 April 22nd, with what

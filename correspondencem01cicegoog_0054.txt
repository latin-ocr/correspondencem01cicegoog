CICERO Ar THE HEAD OF THE STATE. li

Forum J ulii, Lepidus moved up closer to him, to the river Argen·
teus, and the soldiers oi the two commandere began to hold iuter·
course with one another.l One of his officere, Silanus (son ot the
notorious Servilia, mother ol M. Brutus), had fought on the side
ol Antouy at Forum Gallorum and Mutina; but Lepidus, who
was utterly averse from any kind ol affort, did not think that it
was incumbent on him to do anything more than retuso to gire
Silanus any command. Still Lepidus was apparently loyal to the
State, und was earnestly supported in that course by his lieuteuant
Laterensis. Lepidus continued to appear to cooperate with Plan·
cus, who would seem at this time to have been much more staunoh
in his allegiance, and, if we may judge from his letters, to have
been very solicitous to retain Lepidus in his loyulty3 but he was
sore perplexod3 ho feared both disatlection iu the army of
Lepidus, and treachery in their general-the ulcerous place was
but skinnod and filmed, as he expresses it.†

The disappointment ol (licero at the escape of Antouy is
shown especially in hie correspondenoe with Plancus. Oioero
reminds him that a foe’s final destruction is as sweet as his first
repulse, and urges him to leave not a spark ol this most horrible
war alive. ‘Whoevsr crushes Antouy will be the finisher ol the
war. Homer, remember, does not style Ajax or Achilles but
Ulysses as the “city-teker.''' Vigorous action is whatis re·
quired. Plancus should not refer any matters to the Sancte
where his proposals will meet with opposition. No, he must be
soli-reliant. ‘Be your own Senate: follow where the interests
ol the State lead you, and see that we hear ol tho accomplishment
ol some signal success before we think ol its possibility.'‡

Plancus had orossed to Rhoue on tho aoth ot April (8453
855, l), and received news ot the Battle ol Mutina a lew days
later, while still in the territory of the Allobroges. He wrote to
Cicero, almost assuming that Lepidus would join with Antouy.

His view in briei is this (848, 2)-‘1f Antouy has no forces to

‘ ⁸⁶9, l ; 872, l. Antouy appears to have sent messengers to Pollio and Plancus
also, to solicit their maistanoe (855, l).

†870, 3, ad noa possum non cotoneum, at qaid intra eatam subest
calsaria, quod prius nuere potest quam coiri curarique ponas.

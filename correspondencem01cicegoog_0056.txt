CICERO AT THE ΗΕΑΙ) 01* THE STATE. liii

The really loyal Laterensis killed himself before the whole
army! Plausus retreated hastily to Cularo (Grenoble)‚ on the
Isara, where we find him on June 4th (895, 3). There about a
wsek later, apparently on the l2th, he was joined hy Deoimus
Brutus.

Alter his meeting with Oetavian‚ 611 the 221111, Decimus pro·
66611611, 611 the 28111, towards Bononia, hoping to see Pansa.
Hearing on the journey that Pansa was dead, Brutus returned to
Mutina, and started next day, along the Aemilian road, to Regium
Lepidi. He reaehed that town on the 25111, but found his army
so ill and weakened, aiter their long privatione in Mutina,† and
so badly 611161 supplies and transport, that he had to delay there
soma days, probably till about the 29th. He wrote to Oieero
(847), urging that the home govemment should send messages to
that ‘weather·ooolr' (1611116661 uentosissimum) Lepidus, to Asinius
Pollio, and to Planeus, urging them to sontinue loyal to the
State, and not to hars any dealings with Antony. On the 30th
he was at Parma (849), and on May ath at Dertona (854). On
the 6th 116 wrote 116111 the borders ol Aquae Statiellae, and on the
lOth from Pollentia (859). Η6 had sueoeeded in getting posses-
sion 61 that town just belore a dstaohment 61 Antony's troops,
under Trebellius, arrived belore it. On this suooess ha appears
to have laid sonsiderahls weight: it would seem that he did not
expeet that Antony would oross the Alps. But when he saw that
sueh was Antony's intention, he felt sure that Lepidus was iu
eommunieation with him. Aeoordingly he struolr up north to join
Plausus. On the 2lst he wrote from Versellae (875), and on the
24111 6111125111 from Eporedia (877, 878). Η6 appears to have
had some slight hopes 61 the loyalty 61 Lepidus, and stated that
he would not leave Italy unless it was absolutely imperative 161
him to do so. From Eporedia 116 advanoed to Vitricium, from
whioh plaoe he appears to have written 892, alter having heard 61

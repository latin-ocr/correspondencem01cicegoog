return, but these deorees had been vetoed.* Fiually, on June 30,
the Senate summoned up eourage to pass a deoree deolaring
Lepidus a publio enemy, aud oonfisoating his property. This was
ot eourse very proper: but they ought to have taken more deoided
steps to enforoe this deeree and to iufliot punishment on the enemies
of the State. Yet they oould do nothing but pass deorees.† It
would seem that they trusted to Deoimus and Plancus ou the one
hand, and to Ootaviau ou the other, and faneied that they

Antony is alive to-dey, that Lepidus hus joined him, that they have an
army iar from contemptible, that they ere tull oi hopes aud during-all
this is due to Caesar)

Antony and Lepidus also did not stir. They knew that it was
only a matter of time to draw over to themselves the armies oi
Plancus and Decimus. Marone Brutus most unaooountably did
not make any reply to the ⁴urgent appeals from the Senate to
return to Italy.§ Oieero also wrote to Cassius urging him to

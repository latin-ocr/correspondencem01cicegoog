Olonico AT THE IIEAD OF THE STATE. lix

eratever the truth of this may be, it is certain that Octavian had
set himself to obtain the consulship before the year was out, so
that he might have, as counterbalanoe to hie youth, in addition to
hie strong military forces, a strong constitutional position which
would enable him to aot on eqnal terme either as friend or foe
with the other commandere who were his seniore aad at the head
cf considerable armies. Moreover he had many supportare among
the people at Rome, though none in the Senate (897, 3). Cicero
earnestly dissuaded him from his aspiratione and dieclosed in the
Senate ‘the source of these most criminal designs.'' In thie letter
Cicero says that he never saw the Sancte better; not a single

senator, or magistrate, cr private member was found to urge
Octavian's claim. But still the State was agitated3

‘for we are llouted, my decr Brutus, as well by the supercilious demands
(deliciis) of the soldiers as by the extravaganoe of the general. anh one
claime to have intluence in the State proportional to the forces under
his command. No weight ie attached to reason, moderatior, statute law,
castam, duty; none to the expressed judgment, ibe deliberate opinion of
the citizens3 none to respect for after ages.’†

Even in July, Cicero was not hopeless that he would be able to
influence Octavian, though he aolinowledges that he must bring
up all hie anginas tc hie aid in this matter (aia, 4). It would
appear that the Senate compromised the matter by allowing him
to stand for the praetorship.‡ Probably it was on receipt of this
oller that Octavian, after delivering a fine indignant speech, sent

the embassy of centurione and soldiere.§

But the Senate refused this embaesy their demand of the
consulship for Octavian, and said nothing decisivo about the
moneyll The embaesy made a third demand that the vote

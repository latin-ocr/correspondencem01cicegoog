OIOERO ΑΤ THE HEAD OF THE STATE. lxi

discovery that anear’s mother and sister, important hostagss,
were not to ba found, served to create a new alarm. Octavian
occupied tha portione of tha city beyond tha Quirinal without
any trouble, tha populace flookad to him, the three legions
deserted to him. The praetor urbanus, Cornutus, a staunoh
republican, killed himself3 the rest made their peace with the
victer. Through Octavian's friends Oioero procured an interview

and laid strong claim to indulgence because he had proposed in
tha Sancte that Octavian should ba made consul. Octavian replied
witha scoff, that he was the last of his friends to come and sae
him.l

That sama night a rumour spread that tha Fourth and the
Martian legions had renounccd allegiance to Octavian on the
ground that they had been misiniormsd of their commandar's
intention and led against the Sanate under a misapprehansion.
The Praetors and tha Sanata ‘without tha slightast difficulty'
(ripaue ἀταλαιπώρως) believed tha repert. A hasty conccurse oi
the Sancte gatharad in the Sancte-house, Oicero welcoming them
attha door. Tha repert was soon discovered to hc false, and
Oicerc disappearad in a litter.

Put this way, Oicero's conduct in the crisis appears contemp-
tible. But aven granting tha truth of Appian's statements (a very
large admissicn), we must remcmbar that it is tha duty of a leader
to incur no needless danger and to bc athis post when ha can be
oi any service. Because ha spoke fair to a marauder when in
grievous danger, hc was hardly bound to romain neutral when
thare appeared a hope of making an affectiva resistanca to that
marauder. Muoh allowance, too, must be made for tha terrifio
excitemant cf the crisis in which was consummated tha dissolution
cf the Roman Republio. Still Oioaro must have known that his
failure was complete. Pollio had gone ovar tc Antony, and hy
Pollio's aid a reconciliation was affected between Antony and
Plancus. Oicarc's earnast efforts to keep thaso sslf-saekers loyal
had all miscarricd, and his passionate naal for the Republio had not
averted ruin and disastar; ha had no more hopes lalt to ba dis·
appointed, and ha departed ior aver from tha city which he had failed

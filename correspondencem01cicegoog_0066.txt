that plaee, whether it was ‘that he feared the sea‚† or did not yet wholly
give up all trust in Caesar, he disembarked, aud prooeeded by land about
a hundred stadiatowards Rome. But agaiubeooming usuaotedpueeryand
ohanging hismind, he returned ιο the sea-ooast at Astura. There he passed
the night in terrible and desperate redeations: he thought even oi going

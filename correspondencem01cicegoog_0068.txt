CICERO AT THE HEAD OF THE sTATE. lxv

without at the same time the timidity and instability which must
acoompany such highly-strung nervas, and such a delicately oon·
stituted organism. Yet it was only physica] danger before which
Cicero quailed. He had no lack of moral courage when he saw
his way clearly. But his quiok intelleot, his capacity of seeing
every side of a question, which, with his great powers of language,
made him such an eminent advocate, made him at the same time
a most severe critic of the conduct of others, and rendered his
adoption of any course of action a perplexing and painful pro·
cess. In the struggle between anser and Pompey, his judg·
ment and his heart were divided one against the other: how
then could the whole man act any strong part? But once (licere
saw his way clearly, he exhibited as much strength as can be
demanded oi human natura* And he always tried to direct his

conduct by principles, and principles which tended to the greater
glory of his country. Vulgar selfishness was never one of his
faults, however much he may have been enthralled by fame, that last
infirmity of noble mind. He had a real love of excellence no
matter who exhibited it; aud he was rich in that most beautiful
gift that is given to man, perfect freodom from jealousy.†
Cicero was perpetually boastful and vain, but it was a harmless

vanity‡: he was occasionally ungrateful, for example to Gaesar—

⁹ Quintil. xii. l, 17, Parum soriis videtur quibusdam quidsi optime rsspmdit ι’ριι
non se tisuidum in suscipiendis ssd in providendis periculis: quod protavit νοονίι quoque
ι’ριο quam praestantissimo suscepit animo.

†Plut. cie. 24, καίτερ οὕτως ίικριίτιρ φιλοτιμίᾳ συνὸν ἀπήλλακτο τοῦ φθονεῖν
ίτίροιο ἀφθονώτατος ὣν lv τῷ τοὺς τρὸ αὑτοῦ κοί τοὺς καθ’ αὑτὸν ἄνδρας ἐγκωμιάζειν.

1 Ophir. duschan-Davidson, ‘Cicera' pp. 19111. ‘Cicero's vanity is essentially
of the imccnous and peccoris-like kind) Dio Cassius (xxxviii. 12) drawa a very
exaggerated picture of Cicero's faults. He astices that Cicero made many enemies by
the pungcncy of his witticisms (cp. Phil. ii. 89; Macrob. Sat. ii. ³, 7); aud, as it is in
accordauce with human nature to feel indignation at injurias more strongly thau
gratitudo forfavours, Cicero was more feared than loved. ‘Hs also made most bittcr
enemies by always trying to sclipsc the chief men in the State, and hy adcpting
towards all alike a freedom of speech which was unmeasured aad warisoms (τῇ
παρρησίᾳ πρὸς πάντας ὁμοίως aspare ιιιι1κιιτοικοριῖχρόμινοτ) ; and 110 strove to gain the
reputation of being able to understand und say what no one else could, thus aiming at
the semblence rather than the reality of excellence. On this account, aud because hs
used tc bouet himself above all men, and consider no one his equal, but, both in his
speeches alike aad in his conduct, used to despice everyoue and conmder no ona good
enough for him (sal ἰσοδίαιτος cidari ἠξίου siras), 110 became 0110110110 and &amabis

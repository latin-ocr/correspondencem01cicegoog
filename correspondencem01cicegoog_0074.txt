100000, 000 three months later Octavian had taken possession 01
Rome and crushed the republican party, a deserter from that cause
and an active member 01 110 dominant party. With 1100010001
feelings 01 0 renegade, he vigorously opposed the side he deserted.

But before September 711 (43), 0 deorce 01 110 Senate had
1000 passed, probably in June, that certain Roman soldiers, who
had been located at Vienne by Caesar, probably in 709 (45), 101 who
had been driven out by the native population 01 110 tribe 01 110
Allobroges early in 710 (44), should be established iu a new eolouy
by Lepidus and Plancus* Caesar had planted in oolonies in the
Narbonese considerable messes 01 soldiers who had served together
and were thus used to act 10 concert—generally men 01 110 same
legion,† and Vienne was one 01 11000 foundations. The Senate
did not dispossees the Allobroges who had driven 001 110 Roman
soldiers, because, the 10011000 01 110 city having penetrated into
110 provincial towns,‡ the veterane (as always) were Caesarisne,
and accordingly the Allobroges professed, and indeed exhibited
(855, l: 900, 4), loyalty to the Govemment. The Senate, however,
in order 10 maintain the dignity 01 110 Republio, and 010010 con·
oiliate the veterana, ordered that new lande should be assigned
them. Plancus executed the commission, and the flourishing

colony 01 Lugudunum was the result.§

⁰ Why was Lepidus chosen to cooperate with Plancus when he bad joined 100000
with Antouy previously on May 091 110 1001 was tha Sancte, during June, wera 01
11010 wite' end 10 know how 10 10001 Lepidus. They did not support 010000 cordislly,
as his policy, especially with regard 10 Octavian, loolred like a 1011000. Lepidus had a
considerable party supporting him 10 110 Seuate, and it was known that 1100000 Βο0100
would not favour any strong measures which might bc 101000 against him. The chief aim
01110 000010 was 10 gain time 1010000 Lepidus from immediately marching 1010 Italy.
Accordingly they gave him orders 10 juin with Plancus in founding 110 colony.

Vienne wasia Narbonese, and the new colony was 10 10 founded in the territory 01
Plancus. But Lepidus did not participate in the honours 01 110 1000001100; 110

colony always regarded Planum 01000 as 110 founder. Possihly the tirst 100001 acts
01 the foundation took place between June 30, when Lepidus was outlawed‚
and August or September when the sentence 01 outlawry was annulled. Or
we may suppose that Lepidus did not 10100 any part in 110 ceremony, though
he had the right to do so, and accordingly could not he regarded as the 1000100.
1101 1110 better 10 consider that the formal ceremony 1001001000 eurly in August. N 0
mention ia made ot itin the last letter from Plancus, dated J uly 28 (916).

† Thus the veterane 01 110 X. legion wera settled 01 Narbonne; 11000 01 110 VIII.

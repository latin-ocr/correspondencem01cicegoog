made by Cleopatra that she would drink 10,000 sesterces at a
draught3 and the triumphator is said to have publicly danced a
pantomimo called Glaucus* But he also did more serious
work. His excellentliterary style was used in the composition, or,
at all events, the correction, ofAntony's speeohes and edicts. We
know what a very poor stylist Antony was. Generous and un·
suspicions, Antony reposed the utmost confidence in Plancus, aud
even antrusted him with his saal, which was tantamount to giving
him entire power to aot ou his behali.

In 718 (36) Plancus was governor oi Syria3 and during his
administration ol that province, he received the title oi imperator
ior some trifiing successes. He is said to have plundered the
province-a stock charge, which may, or may not, be true3 and to
have forfeited the good opinion of Autony ior so doing—which is
absurd. His real ground of quarrel with Antony was that Antony
was gradually surrendering himself more and more, body andsoul,
to Cleopatra. Ol this Plancus seriously disapproved, with the result
that he became hateiul to Cleopatra;† and when, finally, Cleopatra,
in her endeavour to provohea contest between the rulers oi the
East and West, urged Antony to divorse Octavia-theu it was
that Plancus felt that the crisis had come, aad he had to choose
between Rome and Egypt. He escaped with his nephew Titius to
Rome in the middle of 722 (32), aud was soon followedby mauy
more oi those who had previously been staunoh friends oi Antony‚

Plancus now surpassed himself in meanness. As Antony's
private secretary he knew of Antony's will, and had even been a
witness to it. He knew how damaging some oi the clauses in it
might be tc Antony‚ and urged that it should be published. Plan·
ous knew that it had been lodged, as wills often were, with the
Vestals. 'l'hey refused to give it up. Caesar took it. Antony's
recognition of Caesarion as son of Julius, and his grant of extra-
vagant giits to his own sons by Cleopatra, excited deep iudig-
nationss Plancus related in the Sancte the dotage deeds cf the
love-sich Antony‚ with such meauness and in such detail theta
senator said, ‘Antoay must have committed a vast number of iu-
famous acts the day before your departure: indicating saroastioally

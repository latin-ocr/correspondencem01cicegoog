Gaul about the middle 91 June, have been related in detail in

the previous chapter (pp. xliii-liv), 991 1991 991 19 repeated here.
When Oetavian was eleoted oonsul with Pedius on August 18,

711 (43), Decimus wasone 91 119 first to be deprived 91 119 oom-
mand and sentenoed to death, while Antony and Lepidus were
virtually rehabilitated‚ though the sentenoe 91 99119111 was 991

up from Spain, had joined Antony, and used his influenoe to draw
Planous over 19 119 same side. Deeimus was thus 1911 unsupported.
He made an attempt to work his way round through the territory
of the Helvetii, and the Rhaetian and (191919 Alps 19 119 lfast.
But his soldiers, mostly reoruits, would not 1999 119 diffioulties 91
119 journey: besides Decimus had spent nearly all his money* ;
991 soldiers who would support a 99999 without very reasonable
hope 91 being paid for it were not very numerous in those days.

the last person who 991111 with justice oondemn suoh treatment.
Even Antony was moved 91 119 ohanges of fortune, but sent 19911
99 91191 1911191991 91 Deoimus. The story goes that at the last
moment Deeimus showed most un·Roman weakness. A friend,

⁶ Strabo. iv. 7, p. 205, says that D. Brutus, ‘when dying 119111 11111199,’ was
eompelled by the Salassi, who lived about Eporedia, 19 pay a drachma a man 191 per.

†Appinu (111. 97) says that Decimus voluntarily allowed them 19 depart, and 1919
thern what money he still possessed.

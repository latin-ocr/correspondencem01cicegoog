Rubicon with his general? Caesar sent him with Curio tc Sicily
and Africa, and Pollio did good service, after the disastrous light
at Ruspina in which Curio lost bis lile, in gethering together the
remnants of the army.† After thie he crossed with Caesar to

Graece, and fought at Pharsalia. Viewing the elain of the sena-

torial party after the battle, Caesar said to Pollio (Suet. (laea.

officer named Pollio was reported among the slain; and that a
combination of these two facts led both armies to consider that the

surrendered.

After the death of Caesar, Pollio still continued to govern
Further Spain with three legions, having his residence at (lor-

Cicero in the first half of 711 (43), he professed adhereuce to the

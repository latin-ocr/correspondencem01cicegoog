0. ASINI US POLLIO. lxxxiii

Pollio still remained Antony’s lientenant, and next year was
sent by him against the Parthians in Dalmatia* Pollio conducted
the expedition with success, took their town oi Salonae, andreturu-
ing to Rome celebrated his Dalmatian triumph.† He bad now
fulfilled all that was fairly to be demanded from him of service to
the State ; and he was at liberty to retire from active politioal ser·
vice, and devote himself to the more congenial pursuits of poetry,
history, and oratory. He often spoke in the Senate aud in the
Gourts; but his public life was ovar. In 722 (32) when ansar
marohed against Antony, he asked Pollio to accompany him.
Pollio pleaded in excuse ‘my services to Antony are greater, but '
his kindness to me better known: accordingly, I shall withdraw
myself from tbe struggle between you and fall a prey to the
victor.'‡ He died about 4 an, aged 80, in bis willa at Tusculum.

Roman literature and art owed much to Pollio. Not only was
be patron of Horace andVirgil, but he established the first publio
library at Rome, and made a large collection of works of art to
which he admitted the public.§ 'l'he practice of reoiting literary
works which was so common under the Empire was introduced by
Polliolt But besides this, Pollio was distinguished as apost, an

historian, an orator, and a criticfl Of bis poetry we hare only the
biassed and official opinions of Horace and Virgil.·· One halfline

⁴ of Pollio remains, quoted by Charisius (i. p. 100, 24 K.)-

Veneris antistita Cupra,

θ Scodra, in Illyricum, was the limit which dirided the territories of the two
greater triumvirs, Lepidus haring 1ο content himself with Africa.

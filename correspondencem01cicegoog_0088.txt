0. ASINI US POLLIO. lxxxv

Seneca, the philosopher (Epist. 100, 7), draws a pointed contrast
between the two :—

ί110001 Cicero: his style is uniform; it marchas along slowly and softly
without siuking 10 effeminaey. But Pollio's, on the contrary, is rugged
and jerky (salebrosa 01 assiliens), and, just where you least expect it, sure
to fail you. finally, all Cicero's perlods come to a regular conclusion
(0100100001), Ρο1110’0 10 0 sudden collapse (cadunt), with the exception of a
very few passages which are eomposed according 10 0 definite rule and an
uniform model!

Pollio was one of the most influential, if 001 1100 most
influential, of the opponente 01 1100 Ciceronian style; but his
aggressive and arrogant nature* was irritated to the last degree
by the incressing favour accorded 10 the lueidity and oharm of
Cicero’s language and style of oratory; and in his irritation he
transcended all bounds of 1010 criticism, actually descending to
downright dishonssty. He passed for the most hostile 01 all the
ancients 10 the renown of Cicero†; but that was no excuse 100 1010
publishing in his speech for Lamia-for they who heard the
speech deolsre that he did 001 01100 1100 words-such 0 gross and
scandalous lie as that

‘Cicero was quite ready to disown the speeohes whioh he had delivered
with all his heart and soul against Antony ; 10 publish many times as
many speeches ot' a contrary tenour ; and sven himself to deliver them in
public to a maeting.’

On condition that Antony should spere his life, Pollio added

many more degrcding charges, but so absurd were they that
nobody believed them. He did 001, however, venture 10 insert
such statements in his histories.‡ We hoppily have the judgmcnt

Aa 10100, splendidior Caesar, amarior Caelius, pravior Brutus, veliementior ct plenior at
calentior Cicero. If the 0000 did not forbid, we should wish (with Maiser and Gudeman) to
read nerroaior Asinius. His style was emiueutly ‘musculaa’ Valerius Maximus (viii.
13 ext. 4) speaks 01 Pollio as stercores cisrasttats's (“100001110’)1001000000 excerptam.

⁶ Seneca controv. iv. praef. 4, Pollionem contumacem natura: cp. Το0.0100. i. 12,
Asinii ferociam. We read that the crosa-grained historian Timagenes who attached
tha whole imperial family, after Augustus rsuouncsd friendship with him, lived at
Pollio's house: cp. Senes. De Ira iii. 23.

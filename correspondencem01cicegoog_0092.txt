P. CORNELIUS LENTULUS SPINYHER. lxxxix

Metella* After ansar's murder Lentulus was 080 08 88000 who,
though they had no part in the 8008, yet tried 80 gain credit lor
being participators in it.† On April 21, 80 808 88 interview with
Ciceross He was appointed Proqnaestor 01 Trebonius in Asia by the

tration 08 8888 province alter the murder 08 Trebonius by Dolabella.
His services to the State in that capacity, his pursuit 08 Dolabella,
and bis support 08 Cassius are related by him in an official letter to
the Senate and Magistrates (882), 888 18 8 private letter 80 Cicero
(888). What Lentulus wanted was 80 80 confirmed in the govern-
mental Asia, until Hirtius and Pansa, to whom the province 888
8008 assigned, could find time to take it up. Lentulus would
appear 80 8080 certainly made as much of his services as they
deserved (08. especially 883, 6) ; for they are 808 mentioned by
Cassius (822), nor by Brutus (837), 808 by Dio Cassius (xlvii. 26).
Yet there is no need 80 deny that he performed the duties which
were expected irem an ordinary official with tolerable efficiency.
Later we find him holding 0 command against Rhodes-which
must have pleased him, as he had 0 grudge against 880 Rhodiens-
and directing operatione at Myra in Lycia.§ Plutarch says that,
80 80 was 080 08 88000 who claimed 80 8880 participated in the
murder 08 Caesar, he was put 80 death hy Antony 088 Octavian.

Lentulus appears 8088808008 8 man who aspired to play a

considerable part in public affairs, but did not suooeed in rising
above mediocrity. His literary style is very good, and betohens
acareful 888 finished trainingAl

0. CASSIUS LONGINUS. xciii

nothing but Bedouius dressed up in Parthian costume—a rumour
which seems to have prevailed iu Rome atthis tima* There was
probably not much truth in this; for Cassius was a true Romanin

also s trus Roman in his plundering oi provinciale, and in amass-

iu arms against his old friends: ior the Pompeisn party were his
old friends, and Caesar wss his old enemy. Many a time during
those long mouths of enforosd idleness, tho passionate and am·

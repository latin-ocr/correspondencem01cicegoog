7. Marcus Jourus Bnurus.

General opinion regards Marcus Brutus as an ‘honourable
man,' who, from the highest motivas ol Roman patriotism‚ slew
his benefactor when that benefactor raised himself above the level
cl a citizen, and who died a martyr to the cause ol republican
freedom. It may be well ιο shetch briefly the career of Brutus and
examine how far the general opinion is justifiable.

Rumour or scandal asserted in the generation which succeeded
the death of Brutus-for there is no account in the contemporary

Nicolaus of Damascus-that he was the son ol Caesar. There is
no question at all that Oato's sister Servilia, the wife of Marcus
Brutus, who was lieutenant of Lepidus in his attach on the Sullan
constitution, was the mother cf Brutus and was passionately in love
with Caesar? Neitheristhere any difficultyasto the age of Caesar
when Brutus was born. Velleius (ii. 72) says explicitly that
, Brutus was 37 years of age at his death ;† therefore he was born in
675 (79), when Caesar was 21. This definite statement must be
considered as outweighing the indefinite remark ol Cicero (Brut.
324) that Hortensius began to speak tea years before Brutus was
born, which would fix the birth of Brutus to 669 (85), when
Caesar was only 153 and there are independent reasons for sup·
posing that the number given by Cicero is erroneous.‡ Schmidt
points out that both the friends and the enemies' of Brutus were
interested in spreading this rumour3 the friends as thereby exalt·
ing the patriotism cf their hero, who sacrificed natural affection for
his country; and his enemies, as deepening the guilt of one who
added parricide ιο ingratitudo. This fact that there was every

⁸ Sec the story in Plut. Brut. 6, who says: ἐγνώκει γὰρ, ὣς ἔοικε, νεανίας ὃν ter
τὴν Σερβιλίαν ἐπιμανεῖσαν 1³er: cp. Appias, il. 112.

1 Cic. Brut. 324, Anaia anta άνοννι causae apere coepit quam tu es natur. Nipperdey
(Rheiu. Mus. xix. 291) wishes ιο read sedecim for ανοννα, in order to bring Cicero into
accord with Velleius. He argues that the order iu which the oratore are named in the
Dictoque aa Oratore is that cf date of birth; and it thia is so, Brutus was born after
Calvus. But Calvus seems tc have been born about the same time as Curio, Le. 672
(82), and after Caelius, 669 (86); cp. Brut. 279, 212. Accordingly Brutus was born
aiter 612 (82).

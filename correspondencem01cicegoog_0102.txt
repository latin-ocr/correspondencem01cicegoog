MARCUS ,J UNI US BRUTUS. xoix

for extortion directed against Appius Claudius* He had returned
to Rome before (lioero went to Oilioia, and doubtless expeoted
that the parvenu govsmor (even though he was an err-oonsul)
would not venture to hesitate about enforoing suoh eontraots as
Roman nobles had made with subjeets. When hs found that
Cioero was hesitating in the matter, he wrote in an arrogant
de haut ea baa manner, whioh (liosro justly resented.† The
history ot the relations ol Cioero and Brutus in these affairs has
been related in vol. ιιι, pp. xxviii-xxxii. Business is business;
but it is perhaps pressing business elaims a little too far when
debtors are starved to deathss 'Po an Antonius or a Dola·
bella suoh might bs only a regrettable insident3 but we should
lrave expeeted irom the philosophie Brutus that hs would have
instantly dismissed agents whose zeol enrried them to sueh lengths.
But Brutus, besides being a philosopher, was a Roman, and
Romans had very strong views about business; and the Salami-
nians were provincials. But perhaps we must not bo excessively
indignant when we remember that exeellent people of the present
day ohesriully invest their money in companies who work their
employts, men aud women, fourteen hours a-doy with results
at whioh even dividend drawers are sometimes disoonoerted.§

³ (lp. Aurel. Viot. 82, 3, Quaestor in Galliam proficisci <Caesari> noluit quodie taram
omnibu· displicebat. Cum Appio Claudio im Cilicia fuit et cam iila repetundarum aarum·
retur ipae ne serbo quidem iassarnatua eat. It is probabis that the writer is stating what
was the tact3 but we must always be on our guard against him when we flnd such a
statement as the following, in hia Lito of Cicero, t 3, Aedilis (I. Verrem repetundarum
damnarit, praetor Ciliciam latrociniis liberauit, conari corriuratos capite punivit, and in
his Life oi Antony, i 2, Augustam perfidiore tractavit, a qno apud Mutinam victur, Por-
usiaesame dormitus in Galliamsayit. Ibi Lepidum sibi collegam adiunxit.

† Att. vi. 3, 7 (261); vi. 7, 1 (270). 1 Att. vi. 1,6(·152).

t About this time Cicero, waiting to Appius Claudius, father-indam ot' Brutus,
speaks of him wannly as ‘long sinos the first oi the younger men3 soon, lineato
bo first of the state,' Fam. iii. 11, 3 (266). Such official judgments ot Oiosro's must
not bo taken as his oool and deliberate opinions. Similarly, when he says oi Bmtus,
in the Orator, ‘Who was ever mors respected than you, or more genial (dulcior) Ρ
πο should not regard this aa mere than the marest eompliment. So too, in Brut. 830,
(liuere speaks of his ‘most delighttnl’ (merissima) letters, and in a rather formal oom-
munieation to Dolabella, shortly aiter the death of Caesar, Fam. ix. 14, 5 (722), he
delivers quite apanegyrio ou Brutus, semper amavi, ut aeia, Μ. Brutum propter siaa
rammam ingenium, moriosiores inorsa, singularam probitatem et constantiam. For the
differenee between the official and real opinions of Cicero on publio man, eontrast what
he says about Piso in Plane. 12 aud Att. i. 13, 2 (19).

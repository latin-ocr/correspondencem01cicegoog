letter affcrded him. ‘I seemcd once more to he reculled to the
light of day from a long-continued discrdcr ol my whole constitu·
tion.' But wc must not lay too much stress cu such language in
a work dedicated tn Brutus, aud written by Cicero, especially
when we read in the next clause au equally effusive statement
that the gilt cf the Aleuas oi Atticus was beyond anything pleae·

During the two years which followed, Brutus in public life

acted as one ol Gaesar's ministcrs, aud at the same time was on
friendly relations with Cicero and others ol the republican party.
It is not at all necessary, or even desirablc‚ that a politician should
have no private friendship with these who hold opposite vicws as

Ε. Schmidt‚† that the letter addressed by Brutus to Cacsar in 47
was written at (laesar’s orders, aud that Brutus, as ‘dccoy-duck,'
had been entrusted with the tash cl drawing over the moderate
republicans to acquiescence iu (laesar's rule. We think that a

celebrated letter ot Matius to Cicero, which is instinct with loyalty

Cacsar numquam interpellavit quin quibus vellem atquc etiam quos
ipsc non diligebat tamen cis uterer.

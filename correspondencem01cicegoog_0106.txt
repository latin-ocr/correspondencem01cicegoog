his influance to ensure that it should not be given to the world.
In connexion with these two worlvs, Schmidt excellently refers

(p. 174, note 4) to a fragment cf a letter from Oiesro to Brutus,
quoted by Quintilian (v. 10, 9) :-

Veritus fortasse ne nos in Catonem nostrum transferremus illim (so.
from the Brutus) mali quid, etsi argumentum simile non erat.

Brutus rightly thought it more politic that Cicero should avoid
necdlass attacks on the Caesarian party. Cicero himself thought
ac too; a little before he had said to Paetus z ‘The work for me
to do is not foolishly to say any rash word or do any raah deod
against the dominant party.'*

Cicero had no reason to dread (laesar’s wratht thare were
really no grounds to fear that hc would ‘in bocrish iashicn malva
his retcrt with the swcrd.'† Not only was Caesar wisc enough
tc know that considerable latitude in such circumstances was
advisable, and that tho moderate republicans might discharge
their republican sympathios in·tbat way, and so be less dangercus
in tho sphere of politiae ; bnt wc must also remember that Caesar
was no ordinary Caesarian, and ‘that he still cherished at heart the

magnificant dream cta free eommonwealtb, although he was
unable to transfer it either to his adversaries or to his adherents’
(Mommsen, R. H. iv. 321). Caesar determined to answer the
republican Ouios with tho pen, and not with the sword. As a sort
of an outline sketch (πρόπλασμα) of what (laesar’s work would bc
like, Hirtius, in the spring cf 709 (45), wrote an invective against
Cato, with much praise of Cicero (Au. xii. 40, l (584)) ς and some

time later Caesar, notwithstanding all his duties, wrote two Anti·
:Oatos (Tac. Ann. iv. 343 J nv. vi. 338). In these works he praised
Cicero's life and eloquence aa most resembling those oi Pericles and
Theramenesss

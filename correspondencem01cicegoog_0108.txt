MARCUS JUNIUS BRUTUS. cv

stantly visiting him! Oicero admired Brutus in many ways andr
st a distance; he could tolerate his company for a short time; but
continued personal intercourse with such a rigid, persistent, un·'·
gracious man was a burden†; and he expresses that feeling in the
most courteous way possible to Atticus, who was a close friend of
Brutus. We cannot think, with Schmidt (p. 176, Briefwechsel.
pp. 322-4), that Oicero was afraid that Brutus was suspected cf
hatching republican schemen because he bad just married Oato's
daughter, and thet hc (Cicero) might compromise himself with
the Caesariana if he should be ohserved to have frequent interviews
with the supposed conspirator. But Caesar does not appear to have
had any suspicion cf Brutus at this time: the lrind cf cantion which
Schmidt attributes to Oicero was not characteristic ot Oieero: end
it is hard to believe that in a private letter to Atticus he would
not have expressed himself more explicitly.

When Caesar returned from Spain, Brutus communicated tc
Atticus-apparently in a letter written carly in August, Att.
xiii. 40, 1 (660)-his belief that ansar was intending to return to
the policy of the Optimates, probably because Caesar had stated
that, instead of the prorrseeti urbia the ordinary magistrates would
bs appointed. 'Phe hope which arose when Marcellus was pardcned,

bnt which hed been speedih dispelled, now only very slightly

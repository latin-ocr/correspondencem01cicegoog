into the position of nominal leader ol the plot. And there may
have been the additional reason, ingeniously suggested by Schmidt
(pp. 177-178)‚ that, as Caesar had iu the autumn ol 45 adopted
Octavian, all hopes that Brutus would be ansar’s heir had
vanished ; and to a meu who had received great favours from
Caesar, aud who was deficient iu generosity aud loyalty, as was
Brutus, eucha mot-ive need not have been without its influesce*
Still the tect that Marcus Brutus was not made eveu a second
heir iu (laesar's will, while Decimus Brutus was nominated as such, .
makes us hesitate to adopt this suggestion3 yet there is certainly
evidence, as Schmidt points out (though it does not appear until
long after the Brutuslegend had been developed) that it was
surmised by the friends of Brutus that he would be ansar’s heir,

or at any rate the first man iu Rome after (laesor ε ορ. Plutarch,
Brut. 8 :-

‘Whau certain people denounced Brutus aud bid Caesar be on his
guard against him, touching his body with his haud, Caesar said : ⁴ What?
Do you think that Brutus cannot wait until this frail body (σαρκίον) shall
pass away t' implying that no oue else had a right to his plenitude of
power after him except Brutus. dud it does seem that Brutus would have
baeu assuredly the first man in the city if he had waited but a short time
until Caesar sauls to a secondcry place, and ir hs had allowed (lassare

glory to fade aud the renown of his actious to wither away.’

It is difficult to take this view ol the matter. Rather it would
seem that Caesar, with his prolouud iusight into character, saw the

great qualities of Octavian, aud the absence of anything really
great iu Brutus; accordingly, he designated tbe former as his
successor, while he considered that he had already bestowed suffi-

ciently ample favours ou the latter.† No further reasons than
thessere necessary to account tor the lact that Brutus joined the

conspiracy, or for the prominent part he took init.

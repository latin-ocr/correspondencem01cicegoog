Poor Virtus-a mere name, yet as the truth
I ever serwed thee ; yet thou 'rt Fortune’s slave·

'Phia shows the smallness oi the depth to which philosophy had
snnk in that superficiei aud arid mind. It was not virtue thet was
a name, but Brutns’s conception of virtue thet was a sham. ‘He
seems to have been,' says Mr. Long, ‘one of those who deceive
themselves iuto a belief of their own virtues, because they are
free from other people’s vices! Brutus was a man oi cold feel·

ings, temperate fancies.† He did not passa tumultuous youth,
like so many ol his contemporaries‡; nor arigernus, braciug,
active life: instead, he devoted himself to study‚ and loaded his
memory, if nothis mind, with the maxims of philosophy. But
they remained only maxims, and did not become part and paroel
of his nature. Oi noble birth, well edueated, austere aud oeld-

It is not known from what poet these lines come: ep. Nauali, p. 910. Plutarch, the
panegyrist of Brutus, relatos (c. 62) that, when bidding tarewell to those who were
around him, he gave his hand to each quite cheertully, and declared that he felt
great pleasure that none ot' bis friends had ever deceived him. This is quite the most
attractiva story that is told of Brutus.

†Hence the dulness end want ot vigour in his oratory: see above, p. civ. ‘ln
Latin oratory,’ says Plutarch, ‘he was adequately trained for speeches and altercations;
but in Greek he practised the sententious laconio style ot brevity which appears
sometimes in his lettera' He gives some examples (Brut. 2).

111-11111 CORRESPONDENOE WI'PH M. BRUTUS.

’1110 genuineness 01 Cicero’s correspondenoe with Brutus 1101
11111 seriously questioned in 1741 by Tuustall in au ‘Epistola ad
virum eruditum Oonyere Middleton.'⁴ Middleton replied two years
later hy 01 edition of the letters iu which their genuineness was
defended, and to 41111 Tunstall made 0 rejoinder in 1744. 11
1745, Markland, in a vigoroue worlr,† with many 100111 01 the
iorger, supported Tonstall’s view, mainly ou the ground of inae·
curaoy 01 langoage3 and the question scemed deeided 41104 4110
Epistles to Brutus must go theway 014110 Epistles 01 Phalaris.
That seemed 40 be 10 fully taken 101 granted that Niebuhr

(1828) and Drumann (1838) spealr of the correspondenee 01
spurious, 4110 104401 with contempt,‡ tho former with considerable
10101101 Orelli also in his edition (1831) regarded it 01 spurious.

ὓ Erasmus, writing 40 Rhenanus iu 1520, says (Ep. i. r), ‘Porro, quas (epistolas)
nobis reliquit nescio quis Brats' nomine, nomine Phalaridis, nomine senecas ct Pauli,
quid aliud censeri possunt quam declamatiunculae!

THE OORRESPONDENOE WITH M. BRUTUS. cxv

lost few words oi the book remeined on o new pege; end some
very conscientions copyist copied out the fragmentery words
instead ol beginning et the next full letter.

For whet is celled Book ii. stood before Book i.‚ end both
together formed Book ix. oi Oicero ed Brutum. Thus joined
they make vbnt ie the normcl complement of e book. Gnrlitt oon·
sidem (Jahrb. 1885, p. 564) thet ebout the fourth or fifth century
the seperate books oi Cicero’e correspondence, till then in rolls,
were formed into volumes oi four books ecch. The first eight books
oi Oicero nd Brutum ere wholly lost: end the nintb vves joined

to the three books ed Quintum tratrem to make up s volume oi
four books* 'lbet the ninth book consiste of both ii. end i. is in·

cidentnlly proved by the 1555 thot i. 1, with which M begins,
hes no statement oi wbet book it belongs to nor eny coloured
initiel letter, but there ere some leaves et the beginning which
ere not lilled†.

There vos considerable disorder end loss in the archetype of
the Brutus epistles, just es there ves in the Epp. ed Q. Fr. (see
vol.11.). The nature ol the disorder end loss ie set forth in the
notes to 839, 3 ; 843, introd.; 857, 33 ep. 840, 3; 865, 7. But
it is to be corelully notioed‚ es Gurlitt bns pointed out, thet all the

disorder in the Brutus letters is merely mechenioel, i. e. disorrenge-
ment or loss ol whole peges. The order oi the letters ol ii. end

portel 1., as they appeared in the archetype, is thus given by

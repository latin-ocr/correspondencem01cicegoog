THE CORRESPONDENOE WITH Μ. BRUTUS. oxvii

As we heve written a oommentary on the letters it is not neees-
sery here to go into the verinus historiosl and linguistio points
whioh heve been reisod in the oourse of the discussion. We hove
tried to examine them ull with the help of the distinguished

soholnrs who have done so mnoh for this portion oi the oor·
respondenoe, espeoislly Gurlitt, Ruete, end 0. E. Sohrnidt.

ohsrnoter end the penerel tone ol his correspondenoe would eertuinly incline us to
oonsider them the works of Brutus end not school exeroises. We osu hardly think thot
in ssehool exorciso Brutus would be represented ss writing in such s rude manner ss
he does to Atticus in 867, 3. A luter writer would, we think, here indulged in many
mors rhetorical floun'shes ond written in s smoother style; end he would heve repre·
wntsd Brutus ss very muoh better or very much worse then hs sppssrs in the letter
whioh we now possess.

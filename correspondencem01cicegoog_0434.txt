‘Hmrnro sutem proelio et quartum legionem et omnes peraeque Antonii casm, item
Hirtii: quartem vero, cum cestre quoque Antnnii cepisset, a quinta legione conciam
esse; ibi Hirtium quoque perisse ct Pontium Aquilam!

Antonyhnd the tud, eth, sud etth legions, besides two praetorien cohorte (841, l) ;
Hirtius hed tho tth and ith legions (Phil. xiv. 27) andero praetoriae cohorte (841, 1).

As ffls ith legion wes under the commend oi Hirtius, it was argued by Mendelssohn
(Jahrbiicher fiir Philologie, 1891, pp. 343-4), thet the first sentence above cennot be
right. Manutius had altered quartam (IV.) to secundm (IL), a very slight change.
But Mendelssohn esis, how could Pollio, who is st least s tolerable writer, use
such sn expression us ornnes peraeque Antonii for two legions only (viz. 5 and iil?
He considers peraeque stands t'or prosi. (= praetorios), and thnt we should read-
(a) it Pollio first speaks oi the Republicuniorces, Hirtino autem proelio et IV. (or VII.)
legionem et omnes praet. Antonii eaesae, item Hirtii .· VII. (or Ι V.) vero, &c.; or (b) ir
he spenlrs oi the forces of Antony, Hirtino nutem proelio et ΙΙ. legionem et nunes praet.
Antonii eonas, item Hirtii,· Ι V. (or VII.) uero, hc. He uiso thinks thet probably
omnes stands for cortes (= cohortes).

We venture to suggest another interpretation with some diffidonce. Possibly uns
Hirtii was originally t. ffirui (= id eet Hirtii), and was a gloss either on praeque (‘ ss
much es those ot Hirtius '), or on quartam legionem, in order to signiiy to whom it
belonged. Then, ir we beer in mind the distinction between caesas nnd conones, we
may translate, ‘In the battle which Hirtius iougbt one of his legions, the sch,
sustnined severe loss, as didallthose oi Antony to nn equal extent; the sch indeed, when
it took the camp oi Antony also (ns well us winning the battle), was cut to pieces by
the oth, and on that occasion Hirtius end Pontius Aquila lost their lives’ There ia no
difficulty in using nunes oi three legions, just as in English we cun say ‘nil the three,'
but not ‘ull the two! Perceque is a word used by Cicero, Attii. 8, 1(³t); 19, 2
(so); verr. iv. so.

‘Ventidium quoque se cum legioneVII.,V111., VIIII. coniunxisse! Manutius
iocis s difficulty in these numbers, ior the 'ltb legion was with Hirtius, end the 8th
took no psrt in the wer (Phil. xi. 37). Furthormore, as Ventidius, on his own
responaibility, hed enrolled three legions from ibe veterane oi Caesar (App. B. 0. iii.
66), it is difficnlt to suppose thet regnier official numbers would have been ahached
to the legions formed by such irregulnrly raised forces; or, even il Ventidius had given
them such numbers, thnt Pollio would have known and recognized them. Mendelssohn,
accordingly, writes Ventidium quoque ss eum leg (= legionibus) III. (¹= tribus)
ueteranorum coniunxisse ,· he considers that ths words III. ueteranorum were
corrupted into VII, VIIL, VIIII. With respect to the forces oi Ventidius he com·
